# AIWare Builder v2

## Overview
AIWare is an advanced intelligent stealer framework that uses AI models (local or remote) to analyze and prioritize file exfiltration based on actual content value, rather than static file extension filtering. Designed for Red Teams, researchers, and educational labs.

## Features
- üìÇ Filesystem scanning for common sensitive file types (.docx, .pdf, .xls, .json, .env, .txt, etc.)
- üß† AI model integration (DeepSeek, OpenAI GPT, LLaMA.cpp) to dynamically assess file value
- üìà Adjustable sample size and value threshold for flexible operations
- ü•∑ Stealth mode operation (silent execution)
- üí£ Auto Self-Destruct option after exfiltration
- üî• Persistence installation (Run at Windows startup)
- üß∞ Customizable scanning paths and optional media collection
- üõ°Ô∏è Encrypted communication with C2

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 system
- .NET Framework 4.8+ installed
- Internet connection (if using remote LLM server)

## Usage
1. **Set Server URL** - Configure the endpoint your AI server will use for sample analysis
2. **Choose Sample Size** - Select how much of each file to extract for LLM scoring (default: 5KB)
3. **Set Value Threshold** - Files scoring above this percentage will be marked for exfiltration
4. **Select AI Model**:
   - Local (DeepSeek, Llama.cpp, etc.) --In-Progress
   - Remote (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, custom LLM servers)
5. **Enter AI API Key** (If needed by your selected model ‚Äî optional for local models)
6. **Enable Stealth Options** (optional):
   - Skip AI analysis (dump everything fast)
   - Enable background execution stealth mode
   - Auto self-delete after operation
   - Enable persistence via startup tasks
7. **Build Payload** - Click Build Payload to generate your customized executable

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Binary
A pre-built version is available in:
```
bin/Debug/net8.0-windows/AIWareBuilder.exe
```

### Option 2: Build From Source
1. Open project in Visual Studio 2022 or newer
2. Install required NuGet packages:
   - Newtonsoft.Json
   - System.Net.Http
3. Compile the project (Release mode recommended)

## C2 Server (Optional)
If using remote AI analysis:
1. Deploy a lightweight API endpoint capable of accepting file samples
2. Connect the endpoint to your LLM backend for classification scoring
3. Return JSON structured responses:
```json
{ 
  "score": 87, 
  "verdict": "valuable" 
}
```
